Hello! My name is Steven Leal, and I’m a senior blockchain developer with over five years of experience in blockchain development. During this time, I’ve had the privilege of working on a variety of challenging and innovative projects, including DeFi, DAOs, NFT marketplaces, and crypto payment integration for various e-commerce websites and games.
First of all, I’ve been deeply involved in DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, where I’ve developed smart contracts for decentralized exchanges and various DeFi activities like staking, yield farming, liquidity provision, and lending platforms. A typical example is Ruby Exchange. Ruby Exchange is a fast, fully-featured Automated Market Maker built on the SKALE V2 Network for Ethereum, designed to facilitate low-cost transactions, provide MEV protection, and offer decentralized storage for NFTs.
In this project, I worked as a smart contract developer, responsible for designing and implementing smart contracts using Solidity, Hardhat, and the OpenZeppelin library. I took advantage of SKALE's high-speed and gasless technology to enhance the performance and efficiency of the platform, and improve the user experience. Security was my top priority, so I wrote comprehensive test cases and deployed smart contracts on both the devnet and testnet before launching on mainnet, ensuring everything worked smoothly as expected.
Working on this DeFi platform, I could improve my technical skills and gain a solid understanding of financial protocols and user needs in a decentralized environment. Another example is my work on an ICO launchpad called VulcanPad, where I developed smart contracts for the platform.
A significant challenge that blockchain technology faces is scalability and interoperability, and that’s why, there are so many technical solutions and I have hands-on experience with Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling solutions, including zk-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups, so I implemented these technologies to significantly improve transaction speeds and reduce gas costs. Typically, its TurboTrade, a cutting-edge DeFi platform that focuses on seamless wallet connectivity, efficient token swapping, and liquidity management on various chains.
In the realm of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs, I defined the governance model and worked on smart contracts that facilitated voting and proposal management.
Another notable project was the development of NFT marketplaces. In this project, I worked as a project manager for a small team of six members, including a UI/UX designer, a frontend developer, a backend developer, a smart contract developer, a QA tester, and myself. While managing the team, I also contributed to frontend development and smart contract development using my technical skills.
We worked using Agile methodologies, utilizing Jira for project management, Git for version control, and CI/CD with GitHub Actions, as well as Slack for communication. We held daily scrum meetings to discuss and analyze our progress, identifying what went well, what didn’t, and how we could improve efficiency and development speed based on user feedback.
I tried to ensure a harmonious and respectful environment across the team, valuing mutual communication and collaboration. Throughout this experience, I gained not only development skills but also operational and management skills.
I don't think I know all the angles of software development so I am trying to learn something new every day to improve my skills. I value everyday learning and everyday improvements, no matter how small it is. You know, 'Stay hungry, stay foolish'—that’s a famous phrase by Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple. So, I’m doing my best every day to develop myself to the next level, no matter what it takes.
That’s all. Thank you!
